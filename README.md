A self made challenge for a few of us learning Python at the same time.
This project is intended for us to push beyond what we are familiar with, and in collaboration, show and teach what we've learned.
With this project we are staying within the confounds of the built-ins of Python 3.

The final goal. A functional fruit slot machine game. Display of a payout table. Display of players stats. Accurate calculation
of wins/loses.
